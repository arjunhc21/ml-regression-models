This project is all about using machine learning to make predictions from data.

Think of it like this 👇
	•	You study for 5 hours → you score 80 marks.
	•	You study for 10 hours → you score 95 marks.
	•	Now, if someone studies 7 hours… can we guess their marks?

That’s what this project does. It teaches the computer to find patterns in data and use them to predict new results.

🚀 What’s Inside
	•	📂 A notebook (REGmodCode.ipynb) with all the code and explanations.
	•	⚡ Data cleaning and preparation (turning raw data into useful input).
	•	🧠 Training a regression model (the “brain” of prediction).
	•	📈 Checking how well the model predicts real-world values.

⸻

🛠 Tools I Used
	•	Python (the main language)
	•	Scikit-learn (machine learning library)
	•	Pandas & NumPy (for handling data)
	•	Matplotlib (to make charts and visualize results)

🔍 Why This Matters

Regression is one of the simplest but most powerful tools in data science.
It’s used for things like:
	•	Predicting house prices
	•	Forecasting sales or demand
	•	Understanding relationships (like “hours studied vs marks scored”)

This project shows the first step into predictive machine learning — simple, clear, and practical.
